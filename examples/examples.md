This folder contains some examples of plots produced using data downloaded and processed using the simple-wx library.

- Both Conda environments from the "envs" folder (*scripts-base.yml* and *scripts-base-mp.yml*) were used to prepare these examples.

- The "NEXRAD/Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor Plots" folder contains examples of doppler radar plots, from a single radar and Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) data, both plotted using the *plot_radar.py* script.
- The "HRRR Plots and Meteograms" folder contains examples of plan-view plots and meteograms with data sourced from NOAA's High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, plotted using the *plot_plan_view.py* and *create_meteogram_data.py* scripts.
